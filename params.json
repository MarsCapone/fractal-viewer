Controls available are:\r\n    * (X,Y,R) values for Mandelbrot and Julia Sets, where X and Y are the \r\n    coordinated for the centre of the JPanel. R is the radius of the view \r\n    (the zoom)\r\n    * Julia Set Constant setter, allows the user to jump to a Julia Set of\r\n    a specific constant. The checking for acceptable inputs is fairly\r\n    permissive. It has this Regular Expression:\r\n    `\"\\s*((\\+?|-)\\s*\\d*\\.?\\d+)\\s*(\\+|-)\\s*(\\d*\\.?\\d+)\\s*(i|I)?\\s*\"`\r\n* Ability to set the order of the Multibrot set. i.e The ability to set 'd'\r\nin the generation formula \"`f(Z) = Z^d + c`\".\r\n* JSplitPanes for the main windows (Mandelbrot set, Julia Set and Settings).\r\nAllows user to resize viewing panes accordingly.\r\n* Scrollbar for Settings panel allows user to make Settings pane even\r\nsmaller without loss of functionality.\r\n* Various colouring schemes permitted. Colour schemes set from \r\n`calculation.SetColours.java`.\r\n* Ability to generate different fractal types. All settings regarding this\r\nfeature are found in `calculation.SetAlgorithms.java` which also includes full \r\ndocumentation.\r\n* Ability to use the mouse middle button to scroll zoom. This works best \r\nwith a mechanical mouse.\r\n\r\n##Broken extensions\r\n\r\n* Ability to swap view (swap Mandelbrot and Julia panels) but keep any previous\r\nsaved states.\r\n* Functionality for rotation exists. But other things break. To enable, uncomment \r\nline in ReaxingSettings and in calculation.Calculations.\r\n* Double click to maximise, window. For some reason panels get deleted when \r\nclosed after being maximised. To enable, change `MAXIMISE` to `true` in \r\n`FractalPanelListenener.java`.\r\n",
